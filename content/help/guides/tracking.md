**Tracking** helps you automatically send read manga chapters to supported trackers, so you can keep track of what and when you read it online.

Tracking is currently supported on [MyAnimeList](https://myanimelist.com), [AniList](https://anilist.co), [Kitsu](https://kitsu.io), [Shikimori](https://shikimori.one), and [Bangumi](https://bangumi.one)

- Tracking done **manually** for every manga.
- The last page of the chapter must be reached to have it mark the chapter as read and track it.
- You can manually set the chapter by tapping on the number and then either entering the number in or dragging the ticker up or down.
- After being offline, the tracker will not sync the last read chapter, even after going back online
- Tracking is one-way. Meaning updating status in Tachiyomi will update the tracker, but updating status in the tracker will not update Tachiyomi
