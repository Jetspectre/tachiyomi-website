## MangaDex

### Why are there no results when searching?

[<MaterialIcon icon="videocam"/> Click for video guide](/assets/faq_mangadex-no-results.mp4)
:::

If you're not getting any results when searching **MangaDex** then you need to log in. To do so enter the <Navigation item="webview"/> for **MangaDex** then press the **Manga** drop-down and choose either **Sign up** or **Log in** to proceed with the login.

:::guide
To enter the **WebView** go to <Navigation item="browse"/> → <Navigation item="button_latest"/> next to **MangaDex**, then press on <Navigation item="webview"/> in the top right corner.
:::

### Why is MangaDex slow?
If pages are loading slowly or not at all, try:
- Making sure you have the *latest* version of the extension.
- Checking if **MangaDex** is either down, or is having the same issues.
- Trying to **Clear database** under <Navigation item="more"/> → <Navigation item="settings"/> → <Navigation item="settings_advanced"/>.
- Trying to **Clear chapter cache** under <Navigation item="more"/> → <Navigation item="settings"/> → <Navigation item="settings_advanced"/>.
- Going to <Navigation item="browse"/> → <Navigation item="extensions"/> → **MangaDex** → **Image Server** and then selecting a *different* server location.

### Is there an alternate searching method?
**MangaDex** allows you to search using the ID number to find manga. The easiest way to get the ID is by opening the manga in your browser and looking at the URL.

:::guide
An example search would be **`id:23427`** which would return results for [Candy & Cigarettes](https://mangadex.org/title/23427/candy-cigarettes)

### How do I deal with duplicate chapters in MangaDex?
This can be solved by opening **MangaDex** in <Navigation item="webview"/> and block the scanlator group whose chapter you don't want to see.

### How do I fix chapters from Mangaplus being broken?
Install the **MANGA Plus by SHUEISHA** extension instead and then migrate the manga that uses **MANGA Plus** on **MangaDex** onto the **MANGA Plus** source.

:::note

## MangaPark

### How do I deal with duplicate chapters in MangaPark?
To solve this issue, follow the below steps.

1. Go to <Navigation item="browse"/> → <Navigation item="extensions"/>.
1. Click on **MangaPark** extension and then **Chapter List Source**.
1. Choose an option like **Smart list** or **Prioritize source**.
1. Go back to **MangaPark**'s chapter list and refresh it.

## Mangabox

### What does `Page list is empty` mean?
**Mangakakalot**/**Manganelo** have created new entries for manga on their sites again. Some old entries are obsolete and will not work. To resolve this, [migrate](/help/guides/source-migration/#source-migration) the manga from **Mangakakalot**/**Manganelo** to another source.

### What does `Source URL has changed` mean?
This means that the manga is dead and needs to be migrated from **Mangakakalot**/**Manganelo** to a different source. Refer to the guide for **Page list is empty** above.

### How do I fix the `Image could not be decoded` error?
Open the manga in WebView and wait for the image to comes up. If the image isn't loading you will need to look elsewhere to read that particular manga, as some Mangabox sources, such as Mangakakalot, are now blocking entire regions.

## Webtoons.com

### How do I fix the `Page list is empty` error?
You will have to open the manga entry in WebView and verify your age, as Webtoons has recently added age verifications on their site.

## Japscan

### Why are some Japscan chapters not loading?
Japscan has some manga that are scrambled using a different algorithm than others on their site. If you encounter a manga being scrambled, use a different source to read.

## KissManga and MangaRock

::: collapse Where is KissManga?
**KissManga** went under permanently in August 2020, we will not add something that doesn't exist back..
:::

:::collapse Where is MangaRock
**MangaRock** converted from a piracy app and went legit, they are now called **INKR** but is nowhere near what they were before.
